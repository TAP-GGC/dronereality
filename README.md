# Using Drones and Block Coding to Teach Basic Programming
## Description
- Difficulty Level: Intermediate <br>
- Target Audience: Middle School and Up <br>
- Duration of workshop: Approximately 1 Hour <br>
- Needed Materials: Codrone Lite, Computer with bluetooth support. <br>
- Using Codrone Lites, the aim of this project is to teach others about basic programming concepts through changing the behavior of the drones with block coding. <br>
- Codrones are small and simple drones that are designed to be programmable in various languages including block coding and python.

## Outreach Activities
1. Classroom Workshops on Apr 14, Apr 20, and Apr 20, 2020: workshop demo to 1001 level IT students at GGC, to spark interests in IT and STEM


## Results
### Demographics & Pre-Survey Results: 
Our study was conducted with 68 college students, the majority consisting of Sophomores and Juniors between the ages  18-23. In the beginning of our workshop 69% of students had no programming experience. Over 50% of students reported they had no or vague knowledge of what a for loop even is. While strangely, 64.7% reported had knowledge of what an if/else statement was. Originally there was no indication whether or not students wanted to learn technology.
### Post-Survey & Conclusions: 
Outstandingly after the workshop 86.8% and 77.1% of students reported that they knew if/else statements and for loops. After the workshop 84% of students indicated they would consider or would pursue learning new technologies. In conclusion, we were able to teach fundamental programming skills and inspire a large demographic of students with no programming skills to consider seeking out information technology courses.
